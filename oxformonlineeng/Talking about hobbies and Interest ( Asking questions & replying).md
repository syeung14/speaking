Hello and welcome everyone, I am Niharika and in today's lesson we are gonna talk about
hobbies and interest. Well when you talk about hobbies and interest, it's a great way to
make new friends, to get to know someone better.
So, in this lesson we are gonna learn how to ask about someone's hobbies and how to
reply. So here I have three questions and these questions would help you to ask someone
about their hobbies and interests. So they are very basic, they are very simple, I don't
want it to be tricky, so lets get started with it. So the first one is, what do you
like doing? So, again as I said, its very basic and very simple, when you meet someone,
probably you know you are in a restaurant and your friend brings in her fianc√© along
with her, so of course now you wanna start talking to this person. So there are various
things that you would talk about and talking about hobbies would really help you to get
to know him better. The right question would be, so what do you like doing? That's how
you would ask, another question here is, What sort of hobbies do you have? Now this question
would be perfect in a situation when you are on a date, you meeting a new girl or probably
meeting a guy, that"s the right question to pop, what sort of hobbies do you have? So
of course the person will start replying and you would get to know that person much better.
So go ahead and ask this and then the third question is, what do you do in your free time?
Again this is very basic and very simple, so I'm sure it would not skip your mind ask
what do you do in your free time? So free time is basically, when you're doing nothing
and you like to get busy with something that you really like, so that's what this question
is all about. What do you like to do in your free time? So hobbies and interests are something
that you like to do in your free time, something that you are very happy to be busy with, so
these are the questions that you can use, but how to reply to these questions is a little
tricky, so lets learn that. Here are some phrases that would help you to reply to the
questions that we've learnt . The first one is again very basic and simple, I like or
I love. So I like Football, I love Swimming, so now I like or I love will be followed by
a noun or by a Gerund, which is the Ing form. So you can say, I love football or I love
photography or you can use the gerund form like, I like watching football, so this is
something that you really like or you love to do, its very simple and at times, if you
just end up using this expression that, I love watching football or I love tennis or
I love playing tennis. Its so basic that, it would just sound as if you are a little
baby answering to that question. So lets get to some other expressions, that would be much
better. The second one is, I spend a lot of time, now here when you say, I spend a lot
of time, you do not follow it with a noun. It is always followed by a gerund or by the
Ing form, for example, I spend a lot of time clicking pictures, so this phrase is always
followed by the Ing form. I spend a lot of time watching TV, I spend a lot of time playing
tennis, so this is the way you would reply. The third expression that I have for you is,
I am really into Football. So, again when you end up using this phrase, I'm really into
something, you either follow it with a noun or you follow it with a gerund, which is the
Ing form. Now if you want to just keep it very basic, you can just say, I am into swimming
or I am into clicking pictures. If you wanna keep it simple, but if you want to emphasize
in something, so for emphasis you end up using the word really or quite. I'm quite into clicking
pictures these days or I'm really into swimming, so here you emphasize on your hobby, the reason
because, you really like doing it. You want to show your enthusiasm and your interest
to that other person, when you're replying to his question. Then the forth one is, I
am keen on, so I am keen on knitting or I am keen on skating, so again when you end
up using this expression, you can follow it with a noun, its followed by noun or, its
followed by a gerund, but yes it is another expression that would help you to answer about
your hobbies to talk about your hobbies, I am keen on reading books or I am keen on yoga,
which means that you like doing yoga and then the last one is I enjoy, so I enjoy reading,
I enjoy swimming, I enjoy playing football, I enjoy clicking pictures. So these are certain
hobbies that you can talk about by starting your phrase using, I enjoy. Again this phrase
will be always followed by a gerund form or Ing form. So these are the expressions that
you can use, but as we said that when you are talking about your hobbies, it gets a
little tricky. These phrases are pretty basic that would help you to start talking about
your hobbies, but wouldn't it be nice, if you give more details about it, now how do
you give the details about your hobbies? Well, we are gonna have a look at it
So here are some phrases that would help you to talk about your hobbies a little more,
like as I said, if you just end up saying, I love football or I love swimming and that's
about it, your conversation ends there, no point right, you would not really get to know
the other person or the other person would not really go ahead and talk to you about
little more things, so why not give a reason to why you have this hobby? why do you like
doing something? So, how do you use this? How do you put it in words? Well, lets have
a look. It keeps me fit, so for example, If someone asks you that, So Niharika what do
you like to do in your free time? And I say that I love yoga or I love swimming, so I
would add a reason to it, why I love swimming or why I love doing yoga? Is because it keeps
me fit, so this is the way you would add a reason. Another one is , It gets me out of
the house. So if you say that, I like watching movies, I spend a lot of time watching movies,
then probably you like watching movies in the theatre. You go to the cinema and end
up watching a movie, so that gets you out of the house, so you would again give a reason
saying that, it gets me out of the house, I really like watching movies and it gets
me out of the house. Then the next one is, Its exciting. So probably you really like
photography and you think that its so exciting, you think that clicking different pictures,
clicking the sky, clicking the cars, clicking the people around you, that is so exciting.
So this is the way you would reply and give a reason, that why you like it and then the
forth one is, Its interesting. So probably you like arts and craft and you find it very
interesting. There's nothing else that you would really like to do except for this, so
the reason because, its very interesting for you, so go ahead tell that person that you
find this interesting that's exactly the reason why you like doing it, so these are couple
of reasons, there are lot more reasons, if you know any please do write into us, but
now we are gonna look at some adjectives. Now you would wonder that how adjectives gonna
help, when we are talking about our hobbies and interests. Well, it will, so the first
thing that we learnt is questioning that, what do you do in your free time or what are
your hobbies? what sort of hobbies are you into? So, this is the way we ask the question,
then we learnt how to reply to it and then we learnt how to give a reason to it. And
now comes the adjectives. Now here you are describing your quality, you were telling
that person, because I am creative or because I am outgoing or because I'm active or socializing,
that's exactly the reason, why I love doing this, I'll help you with some examples, so
creative, so when I'm talking to the other person about my interests, I'm gonna say,
you know I really like painting, maybe because I think that I'm very creative and add a reason
and I think its exciting. So this is the way you have spoken a lot about your hobby. Next
one outgoing, so probably you are a very outgoing person and that's why you love hanging out
with friends, so hanging out with friends or going for shopping is one of your hobby,
so you could say, you could use this adjective by saying, you know I'm a very outgoing person
and that's why I love hanging out with friends. Next one is, Active, so probably you are very
physically active person and that's the reason, you love playing football or you love swimming
, because you are very active. So here again, you are describing your quality and that's
exactly the reason, why you like doing something. And then the forth one here is, Socializing,
so probably you go out with friends again, which means you like to socialize. So, socialize
is another quality of yours and that's why your adding to your statement that why you
like hanging out with your friends. So hope these expressions are helpful to you, we all
love talking about our hobbies and our interests, so this lesson should definitely help you
to talk much more about it and go ahead, whatever your current obsession is, talk about it,
so that you make new friends. I'll be back with a new lesson soon. Till then you take care.
