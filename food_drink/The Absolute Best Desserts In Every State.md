Nothing says "America" like apple pie.  Or salt water taffy. Or is it kringle?  
Or cowboy cookies? Maybe biscochitos!  Or possum pie! Can't pick just one?  
Keep watching for each state's favorite dessert.
"What's for dessert?"
Lane cake is one of  
Alabama's most cherished treats —  incorporating bourbon-soaked raisins,  
frosting and sometimes cherries  and other fruit on top.
The dessert is so iconic, it was  even immortalized in the novel,  
"To Kill a Mockingbird," by  Alabama native Harper Lee.  
And it's been a staple of home cooks ever  since the '20s. Thanks to the preservation  
of the lane cake in family cookbooks, fans will  be enjoying this boozy treat for years to come.
Baked Alaska for Alaska! Too  
obvious? Well, this meringue stunner dates  back hundreds of years. And it certainly  
isn't limited to its namesake state.  According to NPR, scientist Sir Benjamin  
Thompson accidentally discovered the recipe  during a cooking experiment with meringue.
"What about a nice cupcake?"
"No."
"Rice krispie treat?"
"No, Baked Alaska."
The Baked Alaska we now know gained  a following through its featuring in  
restaurants like New York City's Delmonico's.  Wealthy patrons came there to sample the treat,  
which is cake topped with ice cream, covered in  meringue — all very briefly baked. Even though  
this dish may not have originated in Alaska,  its iconic status earns it a spot on our list.
Arizona: Sopapilla Sopapillas originated in New Mexico,  
but this comforting doughy confection is now  famous in Arizona. The pillow-like sweet is  
deep-fried, covered in honey or syrup, then  sprinkled with cinnamon or powdered sugar.
"Sopapillas! Can I get some  sopapillas, please? Sweet."
According to What's Cooking America, the  original recipe dates back over 200 years.  
But, proving that a good thing can  last forever, there are still plenty  
of restaurants serving these warm, toasty  treats all over The Grand Canyon State.
Arkansas: Possum Pie In the Southern state of Arkansas,  
possum pie reigns supreme. And thankfully,  it's not actually made with possums. Instead,  
layers of vanilla, chocolate custard and  pecans are folded together with cream cheese.  
Then, everything's covered in whipped cream and a  sprinkling of pecan crumbs or chocolate shavings.
With brownie points for brilliantly showcasing  the official nut of Arkansas — the pecan — this  
deliciously, creamy and decadent  dessert is bursting with state pride.
You might be thinking they're Chinese,  
but fortune cookies actually have their  roots in Japanese culture. Even so,  
the fortune cookie we know today was invented  in California. And of course, both Los Angeles  
and San Francisco claim to have done it first.  While an official winner has never been declared,  
the cookies were first spotted in the state  during the first half of the 20th century.
Their shape may be complex, but the ingredients  are simple; egg whites, flour, sugar, salt, water,  
and vanilla extract. The wafer cookies are  also folded while they're still hot — with a  
message tucked inside — all so you can get  a sweet little glimpse into your future.
"Eat your hat and you will fall in love."

Colorado is home to some of the most  popular snow-sporting in the country.  
And with all those thrill-seekers  freezing their buns off, it only  
makes sense that after a day on the slopes,  the perfect treat would be hot chocolate.
But no one's stopping at regular old cocoa. Today,  
there's spiked hot chocolate, sipping  chocolate, and even cannabis hot  
cocoa — which is no surprise, considering the  state's flourishing and legal weed industry.  
Throw in a few marshmallows and you've got  yourself Colorado's number one dessert.
Though Connecticut is known as  
“the Nutmeg State,” the tree was never really  produced or grown in the state. Nutmeg has come  
to be a celebrated spice in Connecticut despite  this, and found its way into the local cuisine.
Based on a classic recipe,  it's the addition of ginger,  
cinnamon, molasses, and nutmeg that provides  the "spice" part of this treat. And with the  
ability to adapt to almost any shape, this  dessert packs in all the nutty sweetness.
OK. If you're wondering  
whether peaches are supposed to be a Southern  thing, the fruit actually boasts historic ties  
to this Mid-Atlantic state. Delaware's state  flower is even a peach blossom. And some  
cities still hold peach festivals every year,  celebrating what was once a major regional crop.
Bursting with juicy, sweet fruit, housed  in a flaky crust — sometimes with a crumble  
baked on top — in 2009, peach pie was  declared the state's official dessert.
When you're in Florida, you've gotta go local  
with Key lime pie. Floridians have been making  the bright, tangy dessert since at least the '50s.  
But according to Southern Living, it may not have  been invented there. A similar recipe using lemons  
instead of limes was reportedly circulating  in New York roughly two decades earlier.
"What do they know about key lime?"
If you're going Florida-style, the pie should  have a graham cracker crust. And a center of  
condensed milk, egg yolks, and tart, acidic  key lime juice — from the iconic Florida fruit.  
Lastly, the pie gets a generous dollop,  piping, or layer of frothy whipped cream.
If you made it through 2021  
without hearing Justin Bieber's "Peaches,"  congratulations. But if you didn't,  
Beebz has probably convinced you that Georgia is  full of the fruit. Well, he's not entirely wrong.  
Peaches have been the official state fruit since  1995, and Georgia is known as "the Peach State."  
But, as NPR noted, cotton and peanuts are actually  Georgia's biggest exports today. Sorry, peaches!
Even so, peach cobbler remains an iconic  Southern staple. And if you're doing it right,  
locals also recommend serving the dessert  a la mode — with vanilla ice cream.
Hawaiian shave ice is  
another American favorite invented by expats.  According to USA Today, the dish originated  
in Japan — over 1,000 years ago! Japanese  immigrants introduced it to Hawaii in the '20s,  
and since then, it's been a popular  treat for locals and tourists alike.
The Hawaiian version of the dessert is  known for ice that is finer than that of  
snow cones. And favorite flavorings  include coconut, pineapple, banana,  
guava, and strawberry. Asian-inspired  toppings have gained momentum as well,  
and fans go for sweetened condensed milk,  vanilla ice cream, azuki beans, and mochi.
This dessert certainly screams Idaho!  
And while it may look odd to outsiders, the ice  cream potato is a beloved treat in the Gem State.  
They can be found at drive-ins and county fairs  as a sweet summer snack. And according to Insider,  
the Westside Drive-In movie theater in Boise  is the official home of the original ice cream  
potato. It's even got the Hollywood treatment on  "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives" and "Man v. Food."
"Must be an Idaho thing."
But — surprise! There aren't any  potatoes in the ice cream potato!  
It may look like a baked spud topped  with sour cream, but it's actually an  
elaborately disguised ice cream sundae.  The signature faux-tato features creamy  
vanilla ice cream dusted with cocoa powder  to give it that signature spud-like color.
They may be the number one  
go-to for every bake sale in the Midwest, but  brownies were invented in Chicago, Illinois.  
As Time Out noted, in 1893, the Palmer House Hotel  owner's wife, Bertha, asked the kitchen crew for a  
suitable treat for the World's Fair. And we've  been enjoying their genius idea ever since.
"Surely that's worth a brownie."
After Palmer, a recipe for a blondie-like  version was published in 1896, followed by  
a mainstream brownie recipe in 1899, according to  Mental Floss. And while we may be baking brownies  
these days from the back of a box, we have  Bertha to thank for thinking outside of hers.
Hoosiers have been going by that nickname for over  
200 years. And that's why Indiana's most beloved  dessert also goes by the title "Hoosier pie."
This sweet treat typically boasts a  vanilla-forward profile, using a few  
humble ingredients that most people had on  hand, back in the day. But once it's baked,  
the creamy filling takes on a Jell-O-like texture.  
But before you dig in, you won't want to  forget the cinnamon or powdered sugar topping.  
This dessert may seem old-fashioned, but this  is one recipe that stands the test of time.
Here's another invention  
based on what home bakers had in their  cupboards. And the popular Iowa Scotcheroo  
is made from mostly Rice Krispies cereal.  But, as the Des Moines Register put it,
"[It's like] a Rice Krispies Treat on steroids."
This dessert goes next level with  the addition of sugar-packed,  
melted peanut butter, which is  folded into the Rice Krispies.  
After being smoothed into a pan, it's then topped  with a layer of sweet chocolate-butterscotch.  
They're part-candy, part dessert, and  according to Dance Around the Kitchen,
"They are a potluck staple here in  Iowa and are loved by all ages."
The top dessert in Kansas  
was actually first introduced  by German immigrants. And,  
thanks to them, peppernut cookies have  been delighting families for generations.
"Did you know that this is the oldest  and smallest cookie in the world?"
Today, the treats are popular with Mennonite  and Amish communities throughout the U.S.  
The cookies get their name from black pepper,  but anise creates its signature licorice flavor.  
They typically bake to an orange-brown  hue with a deliciously spicy crunch.  
And they're found just about everywhere  in Kansas during the holidays.
Bourbon just may be the flavor of Kentucky  — especially when it comes to desserts.  
From bourbon bread pudding to bourbon butter cake,  bakers aren't skimping on the liquor invented in  
their state. And one of Kentucky's signature  treats is bourbon balls. First spotted in a  
candy store in 1938, people loved them  so much they started making their own.
"Bourbon balls. This is what it's all about."
According to The Spruce Eats, Kentucky bourbon  balls are most-often served at get-togethers  
around the holidays. Featuring vanilla wafers,  cocoa powder, chopped pecans, and bourbon, these  
no-bake treats are packed with boozy flavor.  
Beignets and king cake may come to  mind when you think of New Orleans,  
but those inventions belong to the French.  
Bananas Foster, on the other hand, was born  in Louisiana's famous Brennan's Restaurant.
Ever since then, the sweet, saucy dish has  delighted diners with it's flashy flambe.  
For a tableside show, chefs set the whole dish  on fire by pouring rum into the pan. And once the  
flames subside, the bananas and brown sugar sauce  is poured over the perfect bowl of ice cream.
"Y'all enjoy. Bon appetit. Happy Bananas Foster."
Awarding whoopie pies  
to Maine might be a controversial move.  Because the Northeastern United States  
continue to battle over which state  has been making the treat the longest.  
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and  Vermont are all top contenders,  
but according to the Farmer's Almanac, evidence  points to Maine's Labadie's Bakery — since 1925.
"Look how cute these things are!"
2009 was the first year of the state’s very  own Maine Whoopie Pie Festival. And by 2011,  
it was declared Maine’s official treat. And  we don't blame them. You can't go wrong,  
biting into a cake-like cookie sandwich  with a sweet marshmallow-y filling.
The official Maryland state  
dessert is inspired by the actual Smith Island,  on the Chesapeake Bay. And as the story goes, the  
many-layered cake was first baked for fishermen  during the Autumn oyster-harvesting season.
Stacked high with at least nine thin  sheets of individually-baked cake,  
the treat was originally layered with fudge  instead of chocolate, so it would last for weeks  
at sea. It was a hit back then, and today, Smith  Island cake is Maryland's official state dessert.
Before we chow down on Massachusetts'  
most iconic dessert, let's get one  thing straight. Boston cream pie is  
not pie — it's cake. According to the New York  Times version, the recipe calls for two slices  
of "old-fashioned milk cake" with a vanilla  custard center and a chocolate glaze on top.  
The "pie" name is an ancient relic from the time  cakes and pies were baked in the same type of pan.
"Smooth…chocolatey…heaven."
With its rich creaminess and just  the right amount of sweet chocolate,  
it's one dessert that you won't want to miss.
Michigan is known for its old-fashioned  fudge. And as 12 Tomatoes noted,
"It's a confection that's well over a century old,  
and those who've tried it  absolutely rave about it."
"Oh…fuuuuudge."
A simple version involves chocolate chips  and condensed milk, with more serious  
recipes calling for butter, sugar and vanilla.  Looking for a signature locally-inspired touch?  
Add tart cherries. You can even use leftover  fudge to make another classic Michigan treat:  
bumpy cake. Um… is that  fudge frosting? Sign us up.
A simple, classic staple,  
seven layer bars are a Minnesota favorite. With a  graham cracker base — and chocolate chips, pecans,  
butterscotch, and coconut — it's not hard to  fall in love with these deliciously sweet treats.
They also go by the name "magic  bars" or "hello Dollys" — and  
they've been delighting taste  buds for over half a century.
Mud pie is famous for its mysterious  
origins. According to Eater, some think the  dessert came to be after a waitress saw a piece  
of melting cake and said it looked like the muddy  water of the Mississippi River. Another story  
claims that it evolved from Mississippi mud cake,  which is basically the pie without the crust.
"Cake?"
Either way, Mississippi mud pie is beyond  scrumptious. With its graham cracker crust,  
brownie cake and chocolate custard layers,  with a fluffy whipped cream topping,  
the only mystery will be how your mud  pie disappeared so fast from your plate.
When it comes to Missouri's famous  
gooey butter cake, the story goes that a baker  accidentally forgot to add a leavening agent  
to a cake mix — and the dense, chewy, gooey  butter cake fans know and love, was born.
This dessert incorporates two sweet elements:  a cake layer and a cream cheese layer.  
And at just 1 inch high, it's a unique Missouri  pie-like treat that will win over any crowd.
Quite a few states  
would probably like to claim s'mores as their own.  But in Montana, the treats have become a regular  
indulgence thanks to Big Sky Country's vast  natural landscape. As Bozeman Magazine confirmed,
"S'mores are a Montana and camping tradition."
"You can't have a s'more  without some marshmallows."
Traditionally composed of a roasted  marshmallow and chocolate square  
sandwiched between grahams, Montana Outdoor  noted the simple joy of the treat, adding,
"S'mores would taste good if  you baked them in an old shoe."
It's the Cornhusker State,"  
so it's only fitting that Nebraska's official  dessert would also be corn-themed. According  
to What's Cooking America, salty-sweet  popcorn balls were invented in 1874 when  
unusually hot weather caused corn kernels  to pop right off their husks. And a little  
rain on some sugarcane reportedly coated  the natural-popped corn with sweet syrup.
"Ok, God, lemme have it!"
While it may seem like a tall tale,  
popcorn balls remain a local favorite. Just top  your buttery popcorn sphere with marshmallows,  
caramel, molasses, or — literally  — just about anything sweet.
We have the Basque people to thank  
for Nevada's top dessert. And Gateau Basque is  still popular in Reno, Las Vegas, and Elko, today.
It's made up of a tart typically  filled with black cherry jam.  
And it might also be called a Basque cake,  when prepared with a cream filling instead.  
Keeping with tradition, the pastry must also  be decorated with a fine crosshatch pattern.  
And it's often finished with a  light dusting of powdered sugar.
While apple cider donuts have swept  
the nation, New Hampshire takes  the top prize for this treat.  
These often-seasonal donuts have been an  American tradition since the early '50s.
Locally, apple orchards, farm stands, and  even some pumpkin patches offer these donuts  
by the pack, at the first sign of Fall.  While the batter incorporates nutmeg,  
cinnamon and apple cider, their real sweetness  comes from their cinnamon-sugar coating.
If you're down the Jersey Shore,  
as they say locally, you gotta get  the taffy. According to Digest Online,  
this iconic treat was invented in the 1800s when  an Atlantic City candy shop flooded with seafoam.  
Clearly ahead of his time with a re-brand,  
the owner sold the candy that had been coated  in ocean water, calling it "salt water taffy."
"Is it gum? Is it food? What's the deal?…Oh,  
it's nice. May I try a pink one?"
This New Jersey staple can still be found  at the state's many boardwalk destinations.  
And yes, the candies are made with  salt, so if you're into salty-sweet,  
you'll love getting this  stuff stuck in your teeth.
The biscochito has been New Mexico's official  
cookie since 1989. And they appear at the most  special occasions. According to New Mexico.org,
"The Anise-scented, lard-enriched  shortbread are essential to weddings,  
graduations, and anniversaries, and are  so popular at Christmas that in December,  
biscochitos comprise maybe thirty percent  of the diet of the average New Mexican!"
But it's the addition of whiskey or wine  that separates these sweet treats from a  
traditional shortbread cookie. And with  the final dusting of cinnamon and sugar,  
there is plenty of reason to celebrate!
Some may claim this dessert has  
its roots in ancient Rome, but New York-style  cheesecake is a classic American invention.  
The original recipe was developed in the 1900s  by Arnold Reuben, owner of the former Reuben's  
Delicatessen in Manhattan. And for the record,  the Reuben sandwich was also named after this guy.
Once again, cheesecake is not a cake, but a pie.  But one bite of its sweet graham cracker crust,  
tangy cream cheese filling, and berry  topping, and you'll forget your own name.
"Holy s—." "That's what people say!"
A dessert near and dear to the  
hearts of North Carolina natives, is the  sweet potato pie. And it's no surprise,  
considering it boasts real homemade  mashed sweet potatoes along with  
the traditional additions of vanilla  extract, cinnamon and other spices.
As Southern Kitchen noted, the pie is likely  inspired by West African cooking traditions.  
And in the States, one of the  earliest recipes was published  
by George Washington Carver at  the turn of the 20th century.
Home to the descendants of Scandinavian  
immigrants, lefse is a local favorite in North  Dakota. And as the Cooking Channel confirmed,
"Lefse, Norwegian potato crepes,  are popular in North Dakota,  
particularly during the winter holiday season."
"They roll it out paper thin."
Finding its place among other Norwegian regional  favorites, this dessert is made of simple pantry  
ingredients. Lefse is then served warm,  with butter and sugar, and eaten as a roll.
Both Ohio's Buckeye  
sweets and the Ohio State mascot are named  after the Buckeye tree. But unlike the plant,  
the candy-like treats feature  a peanut butter confection,  
rolled into balls, and dipped in chocolate. As  far as local tradition goes, Taste Atlas noted,
"In Ohio, this sweet treat is closely  associated with college football games,  
Christmas, and weddings."
…or any time, as far as we're concerned.
Fried pies are pure  
Oklahoma. And they're typically packed with  an extra-sweet fruit filling like apricot,  
blackberry, and strawberry. Or  maybe even peanut butter chocolate.
But don't confuse these  with McDonald's apple pies!  
While both are served warm and in  a paper wrapper, the Sooner State  
version is a perfectly scratch-made treat that  you definitely won't find on the dollar menu.
Oregon's famous marionberries are the reason  
for this richly-colored dessert. While the fruit  may be new to some, the Cooking Channel explained,
"[They] are glossy, black-purple, conical  berries with a somewhat tart flavor  
(though sweeter than the traditional blackberry)."
"We enjoy pie. It's pretty evident, I think."
When those berries are baked into a pie, they  burst with tart flavor. And to really do it right,  
the pie can be balanced with a cream cheese  layer or scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.
Thanks to Pennsylvania's Amish,  
the entire state is powered by shoofly pie.  But even locals disagree on a key component.  
The dry versus wet debate pits a sturdier  gingerbread-like crust against a moist,  
molasses custard bottom. But that's not stopping  anyone from eating it. As Taste of Home noted,
"Shoofly pie is to the Pennsylvania  Dutch as pecan pie is to a Southerner."
With a molasses and brown sugar  filling, and dusty crumb topping,  
who really cares what the bottom is made of!
Zeppole are a beloved St.  
Joseph's Day treat you'll find  at Rhode Island's finest Italian  
restaurants and bakeries. And  as Food 52 described them,
"[They're] giant, airy puff pastries filled with  sweet, lemony custard, topped with a cherry."
Well, they had us at "sweet custard."  And with that buttery pastry and  
a cherry on top, they're crushing  the competition in The Ocean State.
Coconut cake is a tradition  
in South Carolina. And as 12 Tomatoes noted,
"A Charleston coconut cake has up  to 12 layers of cake and frosting,  
making it a towering achievement  in cake construction."
This dessert is positively packed with coconut  — from the frosting, to the cake, to the creamy  
filling. Oh, and don't forget the shredded  coconut on the outside for a decorative flair.
If you're a South Dakota native,  
you've probably had your share  of kuchen. The decadent cake-like  
pastry hails from Germany and  is the German word for "cake."
"When the orders come, my God, you know,  they ask for seventy-five pounds of this."
According to South Dakota Magazine, there are  three essential components to a good kuchen;  
a flaky crust, a custard-like filling,  and a beautifully crumbly topping.  
And you might even find some versions  that feature a sweet, seasonal fruit.
The famous Tennessee  
MoonPie is made with sweet  vanilla cookies and marshmallow,  
coated in chocolate icing. As the story  goes, a coal miner once requested a dessert  
"as big as the moon" — and the MoonPie  became a thing. A really popular thing.
"What up, MoonPie?" "No one calls me MoonPie but MeeMaw."
While some home bakers have mastered the treat in  their kitchens, it's even easier to get one from a  
famous box. And the Chattanooga Bakery has been  mass producing the favorite dessert since 1917.
Pecans are a big deal in Texas. They're  
the official nut and tree of the Lone Star State,  and pecan pie is the official state dessert. And  
according to Southern Living, Texas produces  around 70 million pounds of pecans a year.
With a buttery, sweet, syrup-y pecan  filling and a perfectly flaky crust,  
you'll be hoping that a slice  of pie is also bigger in Texas.
Jell-O is Utah's official  
state snack. And we think Green Jell-O  salad should be its official dessert.  
With the oddly wonderful combo of  mayo, cottage cheese, lime juice,  
lemon juice, heavy cream, and sugar, this  other-worldly dish is a throwback stunner.
"I think it says about Utah  that we really like our sugar."
Also known as "Mormon Jell-O salad,"  the treat has deep ties to the state's  
religious community. But while the  question remains as to exactly why,  
we're guessing it's because  it's fun and delicious.
Vermont produces the most maple  
syrup of any state. But while their official  dessert is apple pie with cheddar cheese,  
the maple leaf-shaped candy  remains an iconic treat.
"I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up. We had to  stop at every maple candy stand on the way here." 
"I ate all my gifts for everybody."
As Pieces of Vermont noted,
"Pure maple candy is expensive to both  produce as well as ship around the country,  
but producing it is a Vermont tradition, and  a tradition we're proud to help continue."
Virginia's chess pie features vinegar as a key  
ingredient — and a crunchy top layer that can't be  beat. But while it was originally called "vinegar  
pie," it eventually got a name that attracted a  much wider fan base. As The Cook's Cook noted,
"Chess has nothing to do with this pie at  all, but you must admit that 'chess pie'  
is more palatable on the tongue for  modern diners than 'vinegar pie.'"
Nanaimo bars are a classic Canadian treat,  but they have made their way down south.
"They're kind of like the Kardashian of Canadian  foods. They're famous for being famous."
These days, they're beloved by Washington state  locals. And with a chocolate, graham cracker,  
almond, and coconut crust — filled with a  layer of creamy, melt-in-your-mouth custard,  
and topped with smooth chocolate — it's  no surprise they're a favorite dessert.
West Virginia is home to the  
iconic Golden Delicious apple. And while the  fruit has inspired many desserts over the years,  
there's none more popular than the apple cake.
This recipe has been passed down for  generations. And while everyone's  
favorite Great Aunt Ethel probably  made it her own way, the springy,  
light, sugar-dusted confection  will be a staple for years to come.
The Danish introduced this dish  
to Wisconsin locals, leaving a lasting impact on  America's Dairyland. Inside a ring-shaped pastry,  
there is a fruit, cream cheese, or nut-based  filling, all topped with a sweet icing glaze.
"I had to come all the way from  Scottsdale, Arizona to get one of these."
If you've tasted the Trader Joe's version, you'll  be happy to know their pastries actually come  
directly from Wisconsin favorite, O & H Danish  Bakery. Congrats! You're now kringle-verified.
Wyoming's cowboy cookies  
are perfect for enjoying around the campfire. The  formerly boring old oatmeal chocolate chip cookie,  
gets an upgrade with pecans, walnuts and  shredded coconut to take it over the top.
"Oh my god, that sounds really good,  can I have like a little…mmm. Yeah."
As the Cooking and Beer blog suggested  of these jam-packed beauties,
"These […] cookies are basically the  definition of Wyoming. Not only are  
they breathtaking and remarkable, but they  are also super loaded with deliciousness."
