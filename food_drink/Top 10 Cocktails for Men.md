"Hey careful, man! There's a beverage here!"
Nothing hits the spot on a testosterone-fueled night with the guys
like a good cocktail.
(party music, crowd cheering)
Welcome to WatchMojo.com
and today, we're counting down our picks
for the top 10 drinks men like.

"Alright, gentlemen. It's refill time here."
"You might try some of them local drinks, you know?
A Cuba Libre, pina colada..."
For this list, we're looking at some of the most popular
and beloved mixed drinks, served iced or chilled
around the world, that probably appeal more to
men than they do women.
But if you're a lady who loves these drinks,
that's great, too.

♫ I'm feelin' supersonic ♫
♫ Gimme gin and tonic ♫
"I ordered us a couple of Bacardi Mojitos."

No.10
"Mojito...es un tambien."
Although there are several variations of this classic drink,
the most notable being the Brazilian Caipirinha,
Alan Ritchson would agree
there's nothing like a combination of white rum,
lime juice, mint, sparkling water, and sugar
to get you going.
One of the secrets to making a good Mojito
is in crushing the mint leaves to unlock the full flavor.
"Here is your Mojito."
"Flamin'."
While the origins are uncertain,
with some stating that it was a cure for dysentery
and scurvy that plagued the ships of Sir Francis Drake,
there is no doubt that this delicious drink
is from Havana, Cuba.
"Mojito?"
(exhales)
"You should try it."
"I'll have whatever he's having."
"Sazerac for the both of us.
With whiskey, not brandy."
Named after a brand of cognac
that was originally the main ingredient in this potent drink,
the Sazerac is the official cocktail of New Orleans.
"Two Sazeracs."
"Where's your sense of adventure, James?
This is New Orleans."
Generally a combination of cognac or whiskey,
absinthe, bitters, and sugar,
this drink has been fiddled with in many countries
due to a ban on absinthe in various places,
with those nations using NS (Nova Scotia) flavored liqueurs
such as Pernot, instead.
"Do you know how to mix a Sazerac?"
"Sazerac?" "Yeah."
"Uhh...it's a as-absinthe and-"
"Yeah, it's a form of suicide,
but don't sample one because it'll light up your vest button."
Featured as the cocktail drunk by characters
in countless movies and TV shows,
it's claimed by some historians to be America's oldest cocktail.
"This is the best Sazerac I've ever had!"
"Fix me another one, honey. Right away!"
"Alright, alright everybody!"
"...and a Cuba Libre." "What? What was that?"
"A Molson and a Cuba Libre!"
The Rum and Coke, also known as the Cuba Libre,
is a popular drink in many restaurants and bars throughout the world,
served with either a lime garnish or lime juice.
"You bitch!"
"Why didn't you just tell me it was a Rum and Coke?"
(offscreen) "Can I have what I ordered?"
First created in Havana, Cuba,
the cheap and widespread availability of its ingredients
ensured its popularity skyrocketed,
especially so after the release
of the 1945 Andrews Sisters' record, "Rum and Coca-Cola."
♫ Drinkin' Rum and Coca-Cola ♫
♫ Go down Point Koomahnah ♫
♫ Both mother and daughter ♫
♫ Workin' for the Yankee dollar ♫
The simplicity of the drink's composition
has since inspired quite a few spinoffs,
many incorporating golden or dark rum
rather than the usual white.
-Rum and coke.-
-How about a lime in that?-
"I'm vaguely offended by that."

7.: Tom Collins
"OK, you don't smash the cherry on that."
"Just plop it in at the end."
"Try to keep it in the top of the glass."
"Gin."
Added to the Lexicon of Boozy Drinks
by pioneering mixologist Jerry Thomas,
this cocktail deliciously combines
gin, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water.
"A little birdie told me that one of our guests here
is a Tom Collins man."
Although the origins of the drink are obscure,
it has definitely been around since at least the 1860s,
and is supposed to have been invented
by a waiter in London by the name of John Collins.
Since Old Tom Gin was the recommended brand to be used
in a later recipe that came about in 1869,
historians figure that accounts for the drink's name change.
"This is a delicious Tom Collins."
"What I did, I used real lemon juice."
"It's from our trees here. That's the secret."
"He was squeezing all afternoon." "Yeah."
"What's your drink, Dude?"

6. "A White Russian, thanks."
What do you get when you mix vodka, cream, and a coffee liqueur?
None other than this sweet and creamy cocktail.
Ironically, the drink was not created in Russia.
The name came about due to the origin of its main ingredient.
Vodka.
A slight variation of the equally delightful Black Russian,
which is the same drink without the cream.
"Now this, like other Kahlua Classic Cocktails,
can be enjoyed by men and women alike."
"So don't be afraid, fellas."
The drink's recent increase in popularity
is undoubtedly due to its status as the favorite drink
of The Dude,
the lovable and eccentric oddball at the center
of the cult hit movie, The Big Lebowski.
(offscreen) "Do you want a drink?"
"Yeah, sure. White Russian?"
(offscreen) "The bar's over there."

No.5: Bloody Mary / Caesar
"Oh! That's so good! Oh!"
(offscreen) "And there is vodka in it, but not that much."
The main difference between these two drinks
being the use of Clamato juice in the Caesar,
rather than just plain tomato juice as in the Bloody Mary,
this classic has been called
one of the world's most complex cocktails.
Salt, pepper, celery, olives, Tabasco sauce, and Worcestershire sauce
are just some of the many spices, vegetables, and sauces
that are used to create its unique flavor.
(offscreen) "Maybe you should slow down on the Bloody Mary's."
"I don't think you need anymore."
"Oh!" "Let her have it."
(offscreen) "You're gonna tell me what to do? No."
While many likely incorrectly recommend the tomato-based drink
as an excellent cure for hangovers,
studies have shown that the combination of a Caesar and an aspirin
produces less stomach irritation than an aspirin alone.
"Bartender! Bloody Mary! O positive!"
"A-ha!"
(exhales)
"Sir?"

No.4 Old Fashioned
"Who says this boy can't fly this old plane?"
"There you go."
"Now I'm gonna make us an Old Fashioned
the old fashioned way."
"The way dear old Dad used to."
Created by blending sugar and bitters together,
followed by the addition of a spirit and a twist of lemon or lime,
this is a classic that has made a combeback
after being featured as the favorite drink
of Don Draper of Mad Men fame.
"Gimme an Old Fashioned."
With a name that is said to have originated
at a Kentucky gentlemen's club in the 1880s,
bourbon, gin, whiskey, or brandy
can be the spirit of choice here.
Just whatever you do,
don't mix one for yourself if you happen to be flying an airplane.
"What can happen to an Old Fashioned, alright?"

No.3 Jack and coke
"Gimme a Jack and Coke, please?"
"Jack and Coke."
Question: who knew that Coca-Cola and Jack Daniels whiskey
would taste to great together?
Answer: The United States Bureau of Chemistry
who cracked this dream combination in 1907.
"Jack and Coke?" "Jack and Coke."
Similar to the Cuba Libre,
the cocktail has increased exponentially in popularity
with Jack Daniels having released a beverage
that actually combines the two.
Jack Daniels Black Jack Cola.
If you love the Jack and Coke and want to experience something similar,
try the Piscola: a cocktail that combines Coke
with the Chilean brandy, Pisco.
(mariachi music)
"Ted? What's in a Gin and Tonic?"
"What's in a Gin and Tonic?!"
There are few drinks as prevalent in pop culture as this one,
with apperances in the TV show How I Met Your Mother,
the film The Year of Living Dangerously,
the song "Supersonic" by Oasis,
and several comics and books.
"This is Gin and Tonic with ice."
"Gin and Tonic's always with ice, sir."
"Gin and Tonic does not always have ice."
(offscreen) "Americans always use ice. I'm not an American."
"Get me another one." "Alright, I'll take it. Thank you."
With main ingredients that generally consist of just gin and tonic water,
and usually garnished with lime,
the cocktail was created by the British East India Company in India.
Concerned about the affects of malaria,
the officers used quinine water, or tonic water,
mixed with gin to make sure the troops stayed healthy.
"Can you give me tonic water?" (offscreen) "Aye."
"With, uh...with some ice..."
"and, uh..."
"...a segment of lemon..."
"Uh, yeah?"
"And could you top it off with some...Gordon's gin?"
(laughter)
"A Gin and Tonic?" "Yeah that's right."
Before we take a sip of our top pick,
here are some Honorable Mentions.
"Pop, you wanna get me a whiskey sour when you get a sec?"
"Add an ounce of Sloe gin,
an ounce of regular gin..."
"Would you guys like a Negroni?"
"I don't know what that is."
"It's Italian. Tastes like grapefruit."
"I don't want one."
"Missing out."
"And with our garnish, we are done."
"And that is how you make a Manhattan."
"Uh, just a drink."
"A martini. Shaken, not stirred."
One of the world's favorite cocktails,
and referred to by some as one of America's most perfect inventions,
this classic bevereage combines dry Vermouth
with vodka, or gin,
and with either olives or a lemon twist for flair.
"Dry martini." "Oui, monsieur."
"Wait."
"Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka,
half a measure of Kina Lillet."
"Shake it over ice,
and then add a thin slice of lemon peel."
"Yes sir."
"You know? I'll have one of those."
"So will I."
It has been a favorite of filmmaker Luis Buñuel,
author E. B. White,
and the singer, actor, and author Noël Coward.
As well as film's most famous spy,
who prefers it shaken, not stirred.
"I might as well ask for all the vodka martinis
that'll silence the screams of all the men you've killed."
It became a major cocktail of the mid-twentieth century,
and has given rise to many similarly deliciuos drinks,
such as the Appletini,
Chocolate Martini,
and Espresso Martini.
But for the men out there, nothing beats the original.
"Thank you."

"He'll be nice around the second one."
