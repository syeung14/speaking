Hold on to your `waffle fries` – something brand new is debuting at Chick-Fil-A. The  
home of the original chicken sandwich just announced that it’s rolling out a  
never-before-seen menu item. And believe it or not, it’s got nothing to do with chicken.
"No chicken."
"What do you mean, 'no chicken?'"

Let us be the first to introduce you to the Chick-fil-a cauliflower sandwich. Yep,  
you heard that right. This is the chain’s first totally plant-based sandwich,  
and it’s based directly on feedback from loyal customers who were seeking  
a plant-forward menu item that still tastes, looks, and feels like Chick-Fil-A.
"`Cauliflower` is very nice!"
While it’s pretty safe to assume that anything you can find on the Chick-fil-A  
menu is going to be `craveworthy`, we can tell you firsthand that the cauliflower  
sandwich `is bound to be` a crowd-pleaser, even for the most dedicated of chicken  
fans. Chick-fil-A invited Mashed out to their test kitchen in Atlanta, Georgia,  
to be one of the first to taste this sandwich before it hits the market.

We showed up hungry, `lined up` our favorite dipping sauces,  
and took the job very seriously. Keep watching for the `inside scoop` on the new cauliflower sandwich,  
and our honest review of what’s soon to be the newest star of the Chick-Fil-A menu.
Cauliflower is `all the rage right now`, whether you’re vegetarian, super health-conscious,  
or just trying to add more veggies to your diet. It makes `a killer gluten-free pizza crust`,  
you can turn it into a healthier white rice substitute, and you’re missing out  

if you’ve never `subbed out` your game day chicken wings with Buffalo cauliflower.

And now, you can get it in sandwich form, freshly made from Chick-fil-A.  
The cauliflower slices are pressure-cooked,  `soaked in` a secret Chick-fil-A marinade,  
and then hand-breaded, using the same method as their chicken sandwiches.
That means they're not strictly vegan, as they're `dipped in` a milk and egg mixture 
and then `heavily coated` in CFA’s proprietary breading, just like the real thing. The sandwich is then finished off  
in true Chick-fil-A style, with `two dill` pickle chips and a buttery, toasted bun.

At first glance, this sandwich looks a lot like Chick-fil-A’s original chicken sandwich. In fact,  
you'll need to `take a real close look` to even tell the difference between the two.
                       ^^^^
And while it would make sense that the chicken chain `would have designed` the  
plant-based offering this way on purpose, the `culinary mastermind` behind the new creation,  
chef Stuart Tracy, insists the `uncanny resemblance` is a happy accident.
    [uncany]seeming to have a supernatural character or origin 

Regardless, we `were hooked from the first bite`. The breaded cauliflower  
is full of spicy, `savory flavor` that’s `reminiscent` of their signature chicken,  
but `with a subtly sweeter taste` that comes naturally from the vegetable.
The texture is what really `knocks this sandwich out of the park`,  
though. It’s the perfect balance of tender, but with a little bit of a  
bite. And it’s surprisingly juicy for a vegetable that’s been cooked twice.

The cauliflower `is perfect at soaking up` whatever dipping sauce you decide `to jazz up` your sandwich with. 
The Zesty Buffalo sauce offered the perfect `salty tang` to complement the cauliflower’s flavor,   [tang-sharp smell]
while the Garden Herb Ranch made for a creamy foil to the spicy notes.
Our only word of caution – to all those who swear by Chick-fil-A Sauce, we found the  
sweetness of the sauce to be a bit too sweet to balance out the flavor of the cauliflower.
It’s no surprise that Chick-fil-A `nailed it with` their newest offering. The company has  
spent nearly 5 years crafting and developing the cauliflower sandwich, trying hundreds of samples  
and `endlessly toying with` the recipe and cooking method until it landed on the perfect product.
And once the ultimate cauliflower sandwich was perfected, Chick-fil-A had to make sure it was  
possible to execute it across its thousands of kitchens around the country while still being  
able to deliver the quality customers expect — and keep that `drive-thru line` moving, of course.

For now, Chick-Fil-A's new cauliflower sandwich will be available starting  
February 13 at locations in Denver, Colorado; Charleston, South Carolina;  
and North Carolina’s Greensboro-Triad area. If the new menu item is a hit (which we fully expect it will be), 
then the chain will bring it to menus nationwide – and hopefully a Chick-Fil-A near you.
