Yep, pretty harsh.
It's the reality.
Women don't care about your struggles.
And what I mean when I say this is that they don't care about what `you're going through`.
They don't care about how hard it is to get to the point of view being an attractive man.
All they care about is that they are in front of an attractive men.
What I mean is, a woman `is attracted to` specific things about a man.
What are those things?
Those are usually `alpha male traits`, masculine traits, a man who `has his act together`, who
`has his life together`, `who is stoic in situations`.
Meaning, he looks at problems, he solves them, and he doesn't let those problems completely crumble him.

But when you are a guy who is needy and overly vulnerable, those things are going to completely
un-attract a woman.
You think like okay, you know what, I got this great girlfriend now and I can tell her
about all my problems.
And she can be the shoulder that I can cry on because I'm comfortable with her and she's
my new best friend.
And yeah, women say they want someone to be vulnerable.
But let me tell you the truth.
They don't want that because that is going to un-attract them.
No, they don't care about your problems and `the hardships` and the things that you're going
through on an unconscious level.

On the conscious level they might say oh yeah I care.
I don't want anything bad to happen to him.
I want him to be happy and all those things.
But still, when you're going through hardships, when you're doing things that are tough on
your life, they just want to know that `you have all this figured out`.
They don't want to sit there and be the one to help you or `to build you up`.
This as a man is something that you need to have already figured out in whatever way that
you need to.
Maybe it's watching these videos, maybe it's going to therapy, whatever it is.
The whole point is a woman is attracted and wants to be with a man who has everything
figured out.
That's what I mean when I say that she doesn't care about those struggles.
Again, she doesn't care about them on an on a subconscious level.
I want you to be the guy who has things figured out.
I want you to be confident in all the ways that you can be in your life and confident with women.
And the only way that you're going to be able to do that is through experience.
`They say a rolling stone gathers no moss`.
What I see when I hear that as a man, you need to `weather the storm`, you need to go
through experiences and tough times.
You need to go through times of being broke.
You need to go to the gym and break down your muscles to build them up.
You need to get rejected 100 times or more so you can be stronger.
Physically a little bit.
But most of the time, what I'm saying here `is emotionally stronger`, that strength so
you can be the strong person.

Not just for women, but for yourself.
You're going to go through the struggles of life.
You're going to go through whatever it takes to get to be the best version of yourself
that you can be.

But I want you to be able to do this without the help of a woman, without having her as
a shoulder to cry on, and not relying on her.
A lot of guys feel empty in their lives so they go and they date women or have sex with
women so that they can feel `more full, more whole, like a whole person`.

You need to `feel whole without her`.
It's gonna be better for you.
And like I'm saying here, it's gonna make you more attractive to the women that you date.
It's sad.
I know, it's a sad reality.
Like, it's tough.
You're like, wow, women really?
They don't care about that?
And the truth is, they don't.
They don't.
They just want to be around the people that they're attracted to.
They want to be dating and sleeping with the men that they're attracted to.
Not the ones going through the struggles.
Not the beta males, not the needy guys.
And listen...
I used to be like this.
This was old Tripp all the way from high school to college to my early 20s.
I used to be the guy who was needy, who was not dominant, who was not assertive, who did
not take control over his life and I had to learn those things.
I had to get my act together to say I want to change.
I want to be a more attractive person.
I need to go and get rejected.
I need to go through failures.
And even now in my mid 30s, `there's so much more ahead of me to get me even stronger`.
Yes, time is a big component here.
But even you, if you're watching this and you're 50 years old, it doesn't matter.
You still have the time to push through and become the most confident version of yourself.
And when I say confident, which means mentally strong in some degrees, I mean going through
experiences and experiencing enough so you become competent.
How do you become confident with women?
You `gotta become competent` with women.
You need to go out and approach and talk to women.
You need to go on `a lot of crappy dates`. [crappy:of extremely poor quality.]
You need to get rejected, you need to go through this.
I know a lot of guys sit here and they watch this and they go, well forget that.
I'm going MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) or whatever and I'm done dealing with this.
This is too much.
That's fine.
This video is not for you.
Get out of this channel, that's okay.
But for you who say no, I still `want to live a life` where I am dating women and I am attracting
a woman... well, then this is the truth and this is what you need to do.
And if you can handle that, I'm telling you, it's going to be awesome.

But a lot of guys, they just don't want to deal with it because it's too hard and if
anything, I think a lot of guys who give up on the whole idea of women are beta in themselves.
So you figure out what it is that you want and how can you become competent in all these areas.
And I know again, harsh reality that women don't care about that stuff.
But then again, `you probably don't care about some of the female struggles either`.
Do you?
Do you?
Do you care what they have to go through and all that stuff?
Do you really care what they have to go through to be more attractive to you?
I'm not talking about the struggles of females and males in society, but just the things
that they need to go through.
No, you only care about a woman who's in front of you who you're attracted to and that's it.
There's a woman out there who's unattractive and you know some of the reasons why she might
be unattractive.
You don't care.
No, you're just not attracted to that person.
And when you see a woman who you are attracted to, then boom, there it is.
Same thing for women.
There's the truth.
And if you want to know more about how the `female psyche` works and understand more about
attraction, check out my Hooked program, which I've talked about before.
Get Her Hooked dot com.
I'll put a link down below so you can check that out and learn how attraction works.
But at least this is a foundation to understand.
You need to take control of your life.
You need to build experiences, which build more confidence in you.
