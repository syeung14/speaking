there's a mysterious Chinese balloon
that's floating Over America right now
but people can't decide whether it's a spy balloon or it's just a scientific
weather balloon that got `pushed way off course`.

oh my gosh, you know this is just `a atmospheric pressure balloon` from
Lonzo at first, we're trying to measure the best conditions for Lonzo lambien
and then it just `flew way off course` oh that was a terrible misunderstanding, I'm
so sorry 
all right so the official statements from the Pentagon go like this,
they said we are not going to shoot it down because that could cause a whole mess and a bunch of debris 
and `it could fall on citizens down below` also we do think it's `a spy balloon` but it is not
`posing an immediate threat` okay so
that's what the Pentagon said and then
China said uh hey hey guys `uh our bad man` that's a weather balloon that just
`got off course` the Westerly winds pushed it you know went through the top of
Canada and came down don't worry about it 

so obviously a lot of people are skeptical about what China
says, but we're gonna go over the `multitude of responses` 
everything from the very serious emotional responses to
the funny responses people had and then
we'll talk about whether as Citizens you
should care about this.  is this a big deal or not let us know in the comments
down below and check out other episodes of The Hot Pot boys

Andrew when we're talking about an article going viral
especially amongst the older crowd this
is like as viral as it gets, man, some of
these Yahoo news comments is like, like
20 000 comments in the comments section
uh let's get into the main reactions of course it was `showed down`[competition], man that's
the American way, man even if my neighbor has a balloon fly over on my property I
might shoot it down what's going on man, did something change

how come we can't shoot it down, yeah yeah how how do we have trillions of dollars in in missile
defense systems, but we can't do nothing about this balloon here?! why don't we
take a big net and just capture and
bring it down and then yeah maybe we uh
spend all the money overseas so we don't
even have the needle in the anymore
apparently, you know, just pop the balloon with a needle uh someone said uh well
actually guys uh you know we kind of spy on each other this is kind of a thing
that countries do so probably out of diplomacy, we're probably not gonna blast
it out of the sky come on guys 

come on, everybody knows, man they got something
else in that balloon, man they got
something else in that blue, man it's gonna spread something crazy someone
said wait wait how do we even know that
it's Chinese like? why couldn't it be the
Russians and honestly why couldn't it be
a UFO? it could be the aliens dude

um long story short man I think that there's a lot of people obviously that
don't like this uh I think it's completely fair I do not think Americans
should like this, but of course the way
that people are taking this either low middle or high, it sort of depends on
like their perspective you know and how
like locked in they are to the old days

of course Andrew as is with anything in
the internet nowadays in 2023 there was a bunch of funny responses as well you
can't fool me that's Team Rocket 

uh someone said yeah actually that thing's
just that things gonna pop and then and
then and then it's going to make all the
agriculture into soy plants because
China wants more soy beans and then and
then we'll become soy Boys in it and
it's going to increase the `estrogen` in    [testosterone]
all our men and then they can't fight
Wars,  It's a `ploy`[tactics], someone said yeah man I
can't believe they needed even those
balloons when they already got tck tok
tik tok is a big Spa balloon in your
hands uh and yeah 

somebody said man how come we don't have the technology just
go up there and bring it down oh I know
why we don't have the technology because
China has the technology,
 someone said, man egg prices are as high as that
balloon is right now somebody's got to
do something about the eggs a foreign
power has not entered our air space for over 70 years
well actually the aliens do it every day
well how'd you know it was a Chinese
balloon well clearly it was because look
how badly it was driven I actually
believe them because man if there's one
thing that the Chinese are bad at is driving 

well actually this balloon was
just surveying all the new Chinese
investment prop properties so you know
it's just watching over its own stuff
yeah this balloon's about to pop and
then it's going to be the biggest
`Chinese gender reveal` ever
uh Hey guys actually this balloon was
just taking uh take out orders that
asked me if I wanted pork fried rice
yeah I just thought it was a `gigantic crab rangoon` in the sky so I said yeah
well this is what happens when China
owns half your country due to treasury
bonds and us just printing more and more
money because we want nice and cheap
things from China so uh yeah I guess uh
so be it.

how come all those highly trained operators in Montana like the
gravy seals and Mule Team Six didn't
take it down I mean overall listen at a
time like this I can understand why
people are very emotional about it because they're feeling like hey this is
an aggressive move, right, I think some
people are literally seeing it the
opposite way and saying how is this an
aggressive move it's a balloon they have
satellites on us already, we know this we
actually know that they have satellites
on America so why are we worried about a
balloon that's not going to do anything
to us 

yeah I think that it really does
first of all I think it's a medium tier
issue at least so it's absolutely
something that everybody should be taking serious but in terms of sort of
the emotional responses to it I think a lot of it comes down to like a lot of
people are sort of displeased with the
direction of the country just like when
Trump was in office like half the people
were displeased now that Biden's in
office half the people are really
displeased and sort of like saying that
they wouldn't be displeased if their
leader was in office yeah maybe this
balloon is spying on our politics
because they're just like oh man
America's so crazy it seems like half
the country hates the other half every
single time the president change it's
kind of weird. 

alright you guys let us
know what you think in the comments
section below, is it a big deal a medium
deal or a small deal? I mean man right
now if you made me analyze it,
I think it's like a very high tier deal
to some of the country and it probably
is a medium deal but other people are
taking it like a low level thing you
know what I mean but realistically if I
was to put my opinion on it it's medium.

yeah and I think this just joins a
really long list of things that a lot of like I guess traditional patriotic
Americans don't like to see they don't like to see America just sit here and
watch a balloon from China float over
their land, right, they don't like to sit
here and see this and that they don't
like to see how this is being ran, how
Miss Universe was bought by this person
or how the police of this or those riots
or even January 6th, it's like all these
things there's just a lot of older
people in America who are just on their
phones and see all this media because
media is just so ubiquitous now right
you can consume this 10 different ways
and then everybody's just like man 

I hate this so I guess I guess it's um
yeah I think it's a bigger news and
being more talked about amongst the
older generation of Americans but I do
think it's a thing that that it is
notable,
yeah for sure like geopolitically it's got to be addressed
yeah yeah so I'm not saying it's nothing
guys but I'm also saying like we still
don't know the facts because the fact
that the Pentagon doesn't want to do
anything about it and China denied it I
don't know what else are you supposed to
do as a citizen, 
yeah I mean hey guys you
know we talk about it silly things
serious things here on the hop hop boys
let us know what you think in the
comments section below and uh yeah I
guess more stuff will develop anyway let
us know what you think until next time
we out peace
