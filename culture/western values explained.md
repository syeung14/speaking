I’m Mr. Beat And I’m here in  
the Western World where we do Western Things and we have Western Values.
You know what Western Values are, right? Right?  What’s that? Oh you don’t? Wait, is that why you  
clicked to watch this video? Very well then.  
Let’s attempt to define what “Western Values” are. 
Well first, let me go find my good ol’  trusty dictionary. (Turning to Ellie) Hey  
     - ol' [old lady]
while I’m searching for it, could you play that clip right there (pointing). Yeah that one.

That was from a wonderful debate from 2013 hosted  by Intelligence Squared in which they spoke about  
whether or not “The West” `should be reluctant to assert` the superiority of Western Values.  
I’ll be showing more clips of it later in this  video, just `hold onto your butts` for that.
Now wait a second, I got my dictionary, but perhaps before we look up the definition  
of Western Values we should look  up the definition of “The West.”

(reading from dictionary) “the direction toward the point of the horizon  
where the sun sets at the `equinoxes`,  on the left-hand side of a person  
facing north, or the part of the  horizon lying in this direction”
(looking up) Well `that’s not terribly helpful` at all now, is it.
You might be thinking, I should already  know what “The West” means. After all,  
I spent at least hundreds of hours studying for overpriced Western Civilization classes I took  
in college. And yet, years later I still found  myself Googling what “The West” actually was.  
`Is it a reference to the Western Hemisphere?`  No, not really. It basically is a reference to  
Europe or any part of the world that has historically been heavily influenced by Europe.  
For that reason, The West is often expanded to the Americas, Australia and New Zealand.
Now remember, the opposite of west is east,  so at one point there had to be a divide.
The divide between West and East we see today `has  its roots` in the cultural and religious divide of  
the Roman Empire. For example, folks in  the western portion of the Roman Empire  
often spoke Latin, while folks in the eastern portion of it often spoke Greek.
Later, the divide `became more evident` when the western portion no longer was a thing,
yet the Eastern Roman Empire, or  Byzantine Empire,continued on. And then,  
in 1054, there was the East–West Schism,  aka The Great Schism, which was the first  
major split of Christianity. After it, there were now two denominations in Christianity,  
the Catholic Church in the west and the Eastern  Orthodox Church in the East. This split, combined  
with the early Muslim conquests that spread Islam  throughout Western Asia and Northern Africa, made  
it so that Western Christianity developed a more  separate identity...oh, and VALUES (supposedly).

When `European explorers` began to travel the globe to conquer and colonize foreign lands,  
they brought these values with them. And  missionaries followed them who eventually  
were successful at `converting millions to Christanity`. Or I should say, WESTERN  
Christianity. So where these ideas were not  heavily influenced `were presumably` not “The West.”

If you’ve got 9 minutes, I strongly recommend my friend Dom’s video called “What is ‘the West’”  
over on his channel Cogito. He goes into it deeper than I just did.

Ok, now that we established what “The West” is,  let’s now attempt to define “Western Values.”
Are they simply the values that people who  live in The West have? Well no, not really.
`More on why that is in a bit`, but know that  Western values are rooted in Western civilization  
itself. Western civilization is the heritage of customs, belief systems, social norms, political  
systems, economic systems, and technologies of the West. 
Basically, the values attached to western civilization are Western values. More than anything, 
Western values have been most influenced by the BIG THREE: Greek philosophy,  Roman law, and `Judeo-Christian culture`. 
But to assume those three influences didn’t overlap with  other influences outside of the West is silly. 
For example, there are quite a bit of similarities  when it comes to Western and Eastern religions.
And here’s another thing. When I researched examples of so-called Western Values, I began  
to realize that these are values that most human beings have, whether they live in the West or not.

By the way, here is `a list I compiled of`  examples of what folks called “Western Values:”
Much of these ideas `arose out of` the Age of Enlightenment, and you...yes you  
watching this video right now...probably  value most if not all of this stuff.  
I mean, the only ones on the list that might be a bit `controversial` are probably the “capitalism''  
one, or maybe the “morality comes from a higher power” one. Ok, maybe the “free trade” one, too.  
Some of these seemingly contradict each other.  But overall, even if you don’t live in The West,  
you share many of these same values. And  for that reason, "the world is Western."
Now, it can be problematic when folks say that those values I just mentioned are  
EXCLUSIVELY Western values. Take that last video I just played for you.  

Earlier in that video, Ben said: "these  are values the West can exclusively claim."
This is simply not true. We’ve seen these values in other parts of the world `throughout much of` 
human history. For example, hundreds of years before the Scientific Revolution  
happened in Europe, `science thrived` in the Islamic World of the Middle East  
and Northern Africa. China has valued science more than a thousand years before that!  
Some historians also argue that ancient China also had a version of capitalism,  
with competitive markets, free trade and private property. In fact, during the Qin Dynasty(Chin),  
most property in China was privately owned.  Again, the West doesn’t “own” these values.
Another thing that can be problematic  is when folks say Western values are  
far superior to all other values, to a point where `forcibly spreading` them around the world is ok.
That’s the second clip I’ve shown  you from the extremely influential  
British author Douglas Murray. Here’s another one:
Murray has made a career out of promoting and celebrating so-called Western Values,  
consistently calling for spreading them around  the world. So has this dude, the historian Niall  
(nile) Ferguson. In Ferguson’s influential book,  Civilization: The West and the Rest, he explains  
why Western Values have dominated the world. Much  of his argument centers on The Enlightenment being  
centered in Europe and the unique circumstances  that directly caused the Enlightenment.
At the end of the book, which he  published in 2011 I should say,  
he argued that the West `had actually lost its edge` in the world, 
and that China, `along with the rest of the world`, `would soon be catching up`.
I gotta say, you may have not heard of them, but Murray and Ferguson have greatly  
`shaped the discourse about` so-called  Western values over the past ten years,  
especially with regards to the Islamic  world. Whenever both have talked about  
the Islamic world, they talk about it as if it is `diametrically opposed to` Western Values.
I mean, I do get their points, especially when you  look at sharia law and its effect on how women,  
atheists, and the LGBT+ community are treated  in places like Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.
But then you’re ignoring all the reform  movements WITHIN those countries. For example,  
some within the Sahwa movement in Saudi  Arabia have actively called for more rights  
for women over the past few decades. In another  Islamic country, Iran, women have led protests  
in recent years against laws that require  that they must wear hijabs while in public.
I don’t think Murray and Ferguson mean harm,  but often when they talk about the values of  
the so-called Islamic world we hear only about the  extremists. And you know, pointing to extremists  
as representative of an entire religion has often  been a convenient way to discredit an entire  
country or culture. Imagine if the world only  associated the United States with its extremist  
groups. Like, “don’t go to the United States  amirite...all those white nationalists there.”
In fact, this oversimplification has caused a  modern, worldwide culture war between The West  
and “The Rest.” In other words, there are now at  least tens of millions of people out there who  
think that their Western values make them better  people than those with...uh...non-Western values.
It also has arguably led to an  increased fear of immigrants.
Often, when we see Western  Values brought up these days,  
it’s by people afraid we are  apparently losing our Western values.
But hold on, I thought NATO was  “protecting western values!”
Unfortunately white supremacists have also  latched on to so-called Western Values  
as a way to justify THEIR racist beliefs.  Specifically, they often bring up Western  
Values when promoting the white genocide  conspiracy theory, which revolves around  
the beliefs that powerful people are trying to  prevent “white people,” whatever that means,  
from having kids so that the world becomes...I  don’t know…”less white” or something. Remember,  
race is a social construct. It has no  genetic basis, and was a term invented  
by one group of people to justify that it  was superior to another group of people.
Uh, yeah. Anyway...
In conclusion, most folks who speak  about Western values mean well. However,  
sadly it has also become coded language for  something more sinister that leads to xenophobia  
and racism. Perhaps continuing to  label stuff in society that we like  
“Western Values” is damaging public  discourse and oversimplifying society.
Back to that Intelligence Squared debate  I mentioned at the beginning of the video  
and that I’ve been showing clips  from throughout. After watching,  
I found myself agreeing with the journalist
Here’s another video I came across from 2013,  where this woman from Jordan calls out Eric  
Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, after he talked  about spreading Western values around the world.
I believe that calling values  “Western” does more harm than good.  
No one has to own values, and geotagging  them is counterproductive. It can lead to  
nationalism and xenophobia. Here’s a video where  I present how nationalism can be problematic,  
by the way. Basically, we all love most  of these things- let’s just stop being  
lazy with our language and making it “us  vs. them.” Let’s just call them “values.”
But what do YOU think? Is using the  phrase Western Values actually not that  
big of a deal? What’s YOUR favorite Western  Value? What’s your favorite Eastern Value?  
What’s your favorite Southern Value? And finally,  what is your favorite Northwestern Value?  
Actually...what do you value? Do you  value me? I hope you do. I value you.  
Comment me, bruh. And thanks for watching.
