it's not about like coupons it's about a
respect, Japanese system it kind of looks
like a lot of the characters could be
written with a sword,
yeah let's uh deconstruct the word and
let's come up with a poetic meaning.
Koreans are considered the hottest, 

can you tell the difference between a
Japanese, Korean and a Chinese person, by
just looking at their face, well, maybe
you will after this video.
welcome everybody to the Hot Pot boys
David and Andrew here, 
we're going to be reacting to different YouTube videos that are attempting to break down the
language, the facial feature, and the cultural differences between the main
East Asian groups that often get confused for each other.

yeah I mean Ithink this is a funny topic that a lot
of people have this, you know, this
discussion amongst their friends, but
they are not having it on an analytical
level, I think you know sometimes, it's
funny, sometimes it's offensive, but I
think we can all agree that it's always
interesting and fun, so make sure you
like, subscribe, turn on your
notifications, and let's get into the first clip.

hello everyone this is kaiva, when I
travel abroad, one of the most frequent
questions that I receive is are you
Japanese?
so today I'll tell you the
characteristics of Japanese, this is a
method to recognize Japanese at a glance.
so this was when a flight attendant spilled drinks on Korean, Japanese and
Chinese passengers. Korean passenger loses his temper, he accepts apology and
a moment later, he apologizes to the flight attendant, saying I'm sorry for
getting angry at you just a while ago,
and it's over, in case of Japanese
passenger, they smile and say oh no
problem, oh no worries, please smile
and a week later, a complaint letter is sent to the
airline company. 
Chinese passenger, they get furious and yell, they murmur []
their complaints in loud voice and in Small Voice they ask for their first class seat.
they take the first class to their destination. 

yo this is a pretty funny way to talk about like cultural and
behavioral patterns that are different.
it's just like in situation X how does a
Japanese, Korean or Chinese person react
differently. dude this was so clear I
mean, it kind of did fall in line with
the typical stereotypes that we all
believe about each other or at least the
more traditional version of ourselves.

um like Koreans have extreme emotional
swings, right they're very temperamental,
but they can cool off and feel a lot of
guilt. Japanese people uh they're very
very polite to you but you don't always
know how exactly they feel about you and,
I think this applies more to Japanese
from Japan, of course not really Japanese
Americans as much, and then obviously Chinese uh they will make a fuss out of
things, they do feel anger, but they can
be calmed down if you compensate them
with something of money value, oh man, I'm
not gonna lie, I remember one time, we
went on a church trip and somebody in
our church group was got mistreated,
possibly because they were Asian at this
hotel, because nobody wanted to deal with
them, because you know they didn't have
English as their first language, and I remember they were so mad that it was
like pretty much kind of racist or prejudice against them, but then the
manager came through with like five
Buffet coupons, that was worth like a 125
and it was just like all good.

uh David uh a lot of people also say and I kind of agree that, like North Eastern
Chinese people, Dong Bae Chinese people
and then Mongolians, and Koreans often do
share this kind of like emotional like temperamental background which can be
fun and fiery in in good and bad in
different ways, but why do you think that that is like why do you think they
should be honest, I think there's a lot
of nomadic tradition and that was sort
of like the way of life of people who
are like moving around and hurting animals and stuff like that, but I will
say that even in America, there's
different like Regional sort of like
attitude patterns,  like there's a lot of
white people in Boston, there's a lot of white people in Seattle, but how come
everybody in Boston is so aggressive and
everybody in Seattle is so passive aggressive even though it's on the same
latitude, why is everybody in Texas so
proud to be in Texas, don't mess with the
Lone Star State, I'll tell you what I
blow a hole through your chest, boy, you
know who knows, why are these ways the
way they are, I mean for sure there is a
reason. I will say this Andrew, if a
Korean was as mad as that Chinese guy
was in our group and the managers was
just like uh here's some Buffet coupons,
they might be like, no it's not about
like coupons, it's about a respect, you
have to respect me, like they might have
been like nah like, I'm not rocking with
it, you like violated my honor, you know
and then like, we said you know the
Japanese person they might be like um
the treatment was okay, but then
literally they're gonna like write a
letter and try to take down the whole
thing, 

and why do I think that Chinese people are so impacted by getting money
it's because I think Chinese value
making money and having money so much
that when you give them money for an apology, they actually accept it.
because they understand money is the one
thing that they would not want to give
you, there is actually a saying in China
and I'm sure there's sayings in Korea
and Japan about the differences between
all the Asians, but there's one from
China that says Japanese people love
work, Koreans love their country and
their people, and Chinese love money
and I'm not gonna lie guys, Japanese do
love their work and they love being
'artisanal' about artsy things, man they
love art. Chinese fucking love money, Chinese people love money 

so mainly today we're going to be talking about differences
between Korean Chinese uh Japanese but
we found this infographic online and uh
we're just talking about face shapes
right, uh purely appearance purely
appearance and and I I think this is
very true, um stronger defined jaw lines, oh yeah
that's true single eyelids, kind of pouty
lips, yeah yeah that's that's what they
like a very like pouty small lip, and
also the eyebrows. I find a lot of
Koreans, they like the big straight
'prominent eyebrows' and you see a lot of
celebrities go for that look as well,

whereas Chinese I think it's not as
pronounced, it's subtle, yeah because
they're very fair, whereas Chinese you do
have a split, I find a lot of them when I
went to Japan, their teeth oh yeah yeah
it's almost always crooked, yeah actually,
Mike and I did a video about that, it's
called yaba teeth, 

these clips revolve around the physical differences between
Japanese Koreans and Chinese people,
obviously we're talking about looks
based things, this is the most basic
'visceral' thing that an average person
can understand,  I think when you talk
about climate and geography, and Korea is
made out of granite and Japan's made out
of lava and sulfur, these things are very
grad school to wrap your mind around, but
even a child can see that different, people just look different, 

so I would say that this chart that they came up
with and also this one, picture that you
can find on the internet that is trying
to talk about the differences, it does fall in line with the stereotype,
obviously right now Koreans are
considered the hottest right, I don't
know they're considered, the best looking.
I'm not that that is partially because
of plastic surgery, but also partially
maybe because they find the hottest
actors and partially, maybe because they
do have certain features, that are
considered attractive as well, right but
I do think that this topic can get
sensitive, obviously, when there comes to
uh this feeling of feeling inferior, it
looks wise, you know, if you're going to
say like Chinese have the round face and
then Japanese have the thin face, are we
saying that all Japanese are like better
looking right 

I mean definitely the truth is in a media sense. 
Japan and now more recently in the past like 15 years
Korea has had like a way more soft power
looks advantage over Chinese people, and
the truth is Chinese people are the most
populous people on Earth, they're mixed
with like a hundred different tribes so
there's incredible variability in the
way they could look, and they don't care
about looks as much culturally, like we
said earlier tend to more just care about money and just like
accomplishments rather than sort of like
uh you know this whole package type thing and I just think that that creates
the perception that Chinese people are
not as good looking on an average basis.
and whether that's true or not the
Situation's completely different like we
said because Korea oftentimes, Andrew is
theorized to come from One Tribe of
yazioi people, literally One Tribe created Korea, Japan is primarily
comprised of three tribes of people you
know uh sort of like a Southeast Asian
Guamanian Okinawan look, sort of like an
Asian asiany look and almost I knew that
almost looked like kind of part Western
like Russian Eve from you know what, 
I mean so it's like China is literally
made up of like a hundred different tribes so you're just gonna see like
every look yeah I think and most Asians
that you meet in your life are going to
be Chinese, so you're going to meet some
very attractive ones and then maybe some
not as attractive and I don't think Chinese value looks as much, because I
think the whole wave of Korean media would push people to kind of think about
it more plus they also running the beauty uh skincare product, game so
obviously they care about looks the most.

so if you grow up as a kid caring about
your looks more than another kid, what
are the chances that you grow up to
become a little bit better looking, I I
guess it makes some sense, 
yeah I mean wherever you put your focus in your work
is where you see the progress, I will say
that something, that's really interesting
about China is that a lot of Chinese
people in the Guangdong region, they can
be mixed with taikadai or Southeast
Asian, in the western region, they could
almost be mixed with like Arabic or
Indian people, in the northern region
they could be mixed with like Mongolian
uh you know Turkish, there's so many different looks in China.
you wouldn't believe it however for the
longest time, Andrew it was mostly people from Southern China immigrating to
America for like 100 or 200 years so,
really now you're starting to meet all
these people from all these crazy
regions that are mixed with like all
these different things but they're all Chinese 

all right you guys now we are
getting into the language section both
on a spoken and written level, there's a
way you can tell Asians apart from other Asians
it's by their accent, and only if they have accents,
 foreign
[Music]

all right you guys this clip kind of
shows how Japan and Korea actually use a lot more English loanwords, due to them
having like an alphabetic system, whereas
Chinese try to translate the meaning, so for example, Andrew PapaConnor is in
[] Chinese, obviously does not sound
anything like popcorn, it means bursted flower which kind kind of sounds like
nice and poetic in a way, 
computer means is actually [dear now], which is electric brain also a very interesting way of
framing something that is modern using old words, 

I saw this one comment that actually made me laugh and it was like Koreans,
oh yeah, let's just say this the Korean way, 
and then it's like Japanese like, oh
okay we have to say this word the Japanese way 
and then the Chinese are like, oh yeah let's all deconstruct the
word and let's come up with a poetic meaning that can reflect its actual figurative definition, 
so it's a completely different word and I thought that that was so funny because obviously
Chinese do have some loanwords but there's not that many and when they do
come up with new words for modern things,
it like sounds completely different and
it has like some crazy like Poetic meaning to it, yeah I mean long story

short guys, uh China is the last I believe purely uh pictographic language
left on Earth, so it's almost like
hieroglyphics to be honest, you know what
I think would be interesting to get into in a later video not this one is all the
loanwords that all the East Asian countries share, 
I do think uh both ways, but for the most part mostly from China,
so I think that that would be really
interesting because I believe Andrew 49%
of Japan's vocabulary actually came from China, 

yeah but how however if you almost
go based off of a usual regular everyday
conversation whether it's in Korean or
Japanese, it's going to be primarily
their own language but sometimes when
you go up to the tier of like college
level or like certain terms law, and um,
you know technical stuff, it becomes more
Chinese, all right you guys, let's get
into the way that different languages
are written, because I could see this being confusing for some people
hello
[Music]

boom, as you can see Korean language uses
a lot of circles and angles, it almost looks like in a weird way maybe you're
trying to draw little robot faces or crop circles or crop circles yes,
Japanese looks like almost kind of hipster and artistic, because it's got a
mixture of rigid characters, 
Chinese characters the kanji in there, as well as the Katakana and the hirakana, so you got
all types of stuff going on, in the
Japanese system, yeah, I think the Japanese system, it kind of looks like a
lot of the characters could be written
with a sword like, anyway and last but not least, 
Andrew, especially the traditional Chinese
characters, they look hyper complex and they just look like little game
characters or little Maps or little photographs or little paintings like
Alien Invaders, that video game, yeah they
could look like, they're shooting lasers,
allrigtht, you guys that was actually a
pretty fun, like 101 class, 
I think you can really get into, the food, do Koreans like kimchi? the most obviously do
do Japanese like sushi? the most obviously do 
do Chinese like dumplings, the most obviously they do, but
you know uh this video was not about
like the food I think, it was really
funny to get into Quick anecdotes about Behavior,
look and then language I think one of the most beautiful things is not
pretending like we're all the same but
accepting the differences and
appreciating each other for it,

 and I would like to think that that's like the
place that we can get to as as East
Asian Americans, perhaps or whatever
these you know, there's always these
hierarchies and everybody's trying to
play these games, I get it ,I get it I get
it of course, right you always want to
rank the highest, who doesn't right?
that's your incentive, but I just think
ultimately like have more of these
conversations talk about these things,  joke about them, don't judge each other
yes some of them are kind of true yes
some of them are kind of not true but you know what like.
hey to break stereotypes, you got to know
the stereotype first, yeah and I think that obviously we are American, so you
could say, well how much do I want to
understand these, well you don't have to, you could just see yourself as an
American, but I do think, to truly get to the root and get to a point where
everybody can like legitimately support each other we actually have to
understand our differences, and almost
like get over it and like burn that candle out, and 
uh yeah I just think it's fun to talk about, man, all right everybody we're gonna leave it
right there, 
please let us know in the
comments down below, I'm sure there's
going to be a lot of comments a lot of
uh research comments, probably gonna
throw some statistics out there uh
there's gonna be some nationalistic comments always, I I find them
entertaining, so please let us know in the comments down below, what you think
about these differences what are some
other ways that you would describe the
difference between Japanese, Chinese and
Korean people
