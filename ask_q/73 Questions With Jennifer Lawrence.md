- [Interviewer] Dramatic sky unfolding [reveal or disclose (thoughts or information).]
here in New York City
and I gotta say,
this is one of the more creative places to do an interview.
So Jen, what made you wanna answer
73 questions in a Williamsburg mini golf course?

- During the pandemic, I was really jealous,
'cause my husband started golfing
and he had an outdoor activity.
I'm gonna try to get really good at it today
so that I, too, can have an outdoor activity.

- [Interviewer] Seems logical.
- Plus I heard a storm is coming in.
I was like, let's get outside.

- [Interviewer] And `this seems dangerously exciting.`
- Very.

- [Interviewer] When `was the last time that` you played minigolf?
- Never, or like five years ago.

- [Interviewer] `On a scale of one to ten,`
`how would you rank your abilities?`
- One.

- [Interviewer] So you're telling me
`there's a higher than 0% chance of a hole in one today.`
- No.

- [Interviewer] Well, I hope I'm surprised.
Now, Jen, with everything that's going on,
between balancing your career and your personal life,
`what makes you happiest these days?`
- My family.

- [Interviewer] And what have you done for the first time recently?
- Give birth.

- [Interviewer] Congratulations. 
10 years from now, what will you regret doing way too much of?

who would it be?
- Chris Farley.

- [Interviewer] Who's the first person who left you starstruck? [??]

- [Interviewer] I love real housewives. When do people- - 
She is.

- [Interviewer] Oh, got it. Now `when do people become real New Yorkers?`
- Either after 10 years or if you can `talk trains.`
[talk trains] Stupid shit that happens on the train. 
              When you get on the wrong train. You're a Train-retard (traintard)Made even 
              worse when you're mistake costs you more money and time.

- [Interviewer] And what `do you say to anyone`
who insists that Los Angeles is better than New York City?

Los Angeles is better `in so many ways.`
You'd have to be `a real city rat` to wanna live here.

- [Interviewer] What's `the craziest thing` `you've ever seen here?`
- Well, speaking of rats, `a rat about the size of` `a tabby cat`
walking very confidently through the subway, not afraid of anyone.

- All right.

[Interviewer] What's your favorite wine?
- God, I don't really know.
Just like a red?

- [Interviewer] And what is `the perfect dessert to pair with that glass of red wine?`
- Not a huge dessert person, but I guess a `sorbet.`

- [Interviewer] And dinner parties or after parties?
- [Jennifer] After parties.

- [Interviewer] And speaking of after parties,
your first Oscar's after party, `was that as crazy as it seems.`
- What seems crazy?

- [Interviewer] Your first Oscar's after party?
- Oh yeah, I threw up.

- [Interviewer] Okay, Jen, `you work with tons of talented actors,`
`which actor is the most fun to be on set with?`
- `The most fun I've ever had with` `actors on set`
is Josh and Liam, "Hunger Games".
Hi, boys.

There's so many better directors than me, but maybe.

- [Interviewer] Really hope you do.
And which of your co-stars `blew you away the most` during any take?
- Christian Bale.

- [Interviewer] Why?
- He became a completely different person.

- [Interviewer] Hm, and which actor's work `do you most admire?`

Robert De Niro.
`Can you share with me "your all time favorite,"`
`quintessentially` Robert De Niro, Robert De Niro story.
- He's amazing on set.
He's just the sweetest man in the world.
Still very intimidating.
I invited him to my rehearsal dinner for my wedding,
obviously expecting him not to come,
and when he came, I said,
Bob, you really don't have to be here.
You can go home.
And he was like, "Thank you so much" and left.

- [Interviewer] Oh, that's good.
All right, let's golf.
We got a mini golf here.
What's `the strangest thing` a journalist
`has ever asked you in an interview?`
`Let me just get outta the way here.`
- Well, this isn't a question,
but when I was in China,
they told me that my nickname in China
translates to...

- [Interviewer] Oh! Interesting time to fly.
`I think it's safe to be flying in this weather.`
- Hope `they don't get struck by lightning.`

- [Interviewer] As you were saying, Jen.
- But they told me that my nickname in China
translates to big elderly cousin.

- [Interviewer] What's `the most bizarre thing`
that you've ever read about yourself?
- That I [beep] Harvey Weinstein.

- [Interviewer] Now, `you did back to back films`
for seven years.
`What's the most important thing that you learned`
about work during that time?
- I guess endurance.

- [Interviewer] And `what's one of your favorite memories` of being on set?
- [Jennifer] Damn it.

- [Interviewer] You'll get the next put.
- Chris Pratt one time told me a story
on the set of "Passengers" that involved the word cut
and so I couldn't make it through an entire scene
because every time I heard "cut".

- [Interviewer] Yes!
- Oh, my God.
Wow.

- [Interviewer] Arnold Palmer over here.
Let's keep going.
So what's one memory-
- Go where?

- [Interviewer] Oh, we'll mosey on down to the next hole.  [`mosey on` - walk or move in a leisurely manner.]
We'll figure it out.
All right.
`What's one memory from shooting that still makes you laugh?`
- Memory from shooting that still makes me laugh.
Well, `one time I accidentally took` an Ambien
`instead of` my thyroid medication
in the morning before the "Hunger Games".

- [Interviewer] Oh, God!
And speaking of "Hunger Games",
did anything intimidate you
about your role in that first film?
- Everything intimidated me.
I'm not exactly a physically,
I don't have any `athletic prowess.`
Agh.

- [Interviewer] All right, `give it a swing.`
I'll be behind this melting iceberg
because it's a climate change themed mini golf course.

- [Jennifer] Did it go in?
- [Interviewer] Yeah, yeah.
- Did it go in?
- [Interviewer] Yeah, definitely.
- Sick.

- [Interviewer] Okay, `if a fan must come up to you` and has to interact with you,
what do you suggest they say or do?
- Any kind of conversation that doesn't involve,
"can I take a picture with you"
is always wonderful.

- [Interviewer] That's an important message for your fans.
Now, Jen, `which of your red carpet looks was your favorite?`
- Which of my what was my favorite?

- [Interviewer] Your red carpet looks?
- I don't know.
`Who's ever looked at a picture of themselves`
and been like, "I look great".

- [Interviewer] What do you look for in a red carpet look?
[thunder rumbles]
- Whoa!
To not retain water in my face and cinching.
Lots of cinching.

- [Interviewer] Well, there may be a lot of water
coming very, very soon.
- Yeah.

- [Interviewer] And what do you try to avoid
in a red carpet look?
- Anything that exposes the top of my arms.

- [Interviewer] `Who do you think has the best style in the world?`
- Sienna Miller.
I don't have a ball.

- [Interviewer] Oh, you don't?
Okay, `let me toss you a spare.`
Here you go.
Oh, nice catch!
- I'll stab myself in the diaphragm.

- [Interviewer] Well, `maybe it is unsafe` that you're holding a metal club in this weather.
Let me get that off your hands.
It's time for me to show my skills
and, ooh, sorry.
Let's get back to the questions.
`Do you have any advice for anyone`
who wants to do a pixie cut? [pixie- playfully mischievous]
- First off, that's mean.
Obviously, my advice is don't do it,
think everything through
and if I could have the internet `scrubbed` of those photos,
or not scrubbed, just add extensions to them.
If anybody knows how to do that, that'd be great.

- [Interviewer] Okay, final hole, Jen.
It's time for me to give this one a go.
I brought my lucky `turquoise ball` with me.
Do you think you could provide some golf commentary
in a `dramatic whisper voice` as I give this a swing?
Thank you.

- [Jennifer] All right, here he goes.
- [Interviewer] Here I go.
- Oh, he did not succeed.

- [Interviewer] Rapid fire, Jen,
what's your favorite fast food?
- Checkers.

- [Interviewer] What's your favorite karaoke song?
- "Any Man of Mine", Shania Twain.

- [Interviewer] Who's your favorite person
in the world to FaceTime and why?
- My best friend Justine, 'cause she's very funny.

- [Interviewer] Who was the first person you called
after winning your Oscar
and what did you say to them?
- David O'Russell.
"I'm sorry that I forgot to thank you."

- [Interviewer] Jen, can you go up to that
`giant earth ball thing` and get a closer look?
- Well, I would love to.

- [Interviewer] While I ask three quick questions.
`What's that Earth made of,`
`why is this golf course climate change "themed,"`
and `are there any other causes` that you think are important?
- They're using reused bottle caps.
This golf course raises money,
well, it doesn't raise money,
`but it donates to some of the profits` to climate change efforts
and another organization that I'm very passionate about is RepresentUs.

- [Interviewer] We got a big storm coming, Jen,
we gotta go, go, go.
- What if this is how we die?

- [Interviewer] I refuse to let Jennifer Lawrence die.
`What's her favorite sport?`
- I don't really like sports `but I'll say hockey 'cause they're, you know, hot.`
They look hot.

- [Interviewer] Favorite way to spend a Sunday?

- [Interviewer] And I think we need more real housewives material here.
Who's your favorite real housewife?
- Sonya.

- [Interviewer] And what city should the next real housewives season be filmed in?

- [Interviewer] Okay, and what's one thing.
Wow. - Wow.
It's a Beyoncé hurricane.

- [Interviewer] This looks great.
- Do I look scared?
- No, you look stunning.
Let's shift gears.
`What's one thing you wish you knew before getting married?`
- That Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were gonna do it again.

- [Interviewer] Speaking of marriage,
who cooks more, you or your husband?
- Me.

- [Interviewer] Well, `keep an eye out for my dinner party invite.`
And Jen, congratulations on becoming a mother.
- Thank you.

- [Interviewer] What's one word to describe motherhood?
- There isn't.
- That's two words. - Okay, well, got me there.

- [Interviewer] What's the best piece of advice `you've gotten` about parenting?
- Babies don't get bored.

- [Interviewer] Has motherhood changed your approach to working at all?
- Of course, everything, location, my hours, all of it.

- [Interviewer] So `how do you deal with stress?`
- Not very well.

- [Interviewer] What's the pro and con of being back on set after these wild last couple of years?
- I guess the pro is everybody's a lot cleaner
and washing their hands and everything.
The con is, God, I don't know.
Just normal work and stuff.
Being tired.

- [Interviewer] It's been hard on everyone.
It's crazy.
- Yeah, but mostly me.

on what this movie is all about?
- It is a story of a woman who's coming back
from a very traumatic journey
and she's trying to find her way in the world
and she sparks an interesting, unexpected relationship
with someone.

- [Interviewer] Wow, really cool.
I look forward to seeing it.
Now let's take a time portal back to your childhood.
- Okay.

- [Interviewer] How would you describe yourself as a kid?
- Hyper.

- [Interviewer] D'you have any nicknames growing up?
- Nitro and Floppin'.

- [Interviewer] I could see you as a Floppin'.
And what did you love about school
and what did you hate about school?
- I didn't really love anything, but I hated the bus
and having to ask somebody if you could go to the bathroom.
I guess I have to do that at my job, too.

- [Interviewer] I can see how you still need to do that.
Do you ever get stagefright?
- Yes, I have tremendous stagefright.

- [Interviewer] Ah, so that's why `you come off` as so shy.
- Well, yeah.

- [Interviewer] So when did you first feel famous?
- When I went to a Whole Foods
and there were paparazzi everywhere
and I was like, oh my God, who are they here for?
And it was me.

- [Interviewer] That was you.
It was the beginning of it all.
And when was the first time that you felt successful?
- When I bought an apartment in New York.

- [Interviewer] What advice would you give
to your 14 year old self?
- Get a stylist, honey, do it early.
Don't wait.

- [Interviewer] Jen, we survived this storm
and we are on question number 73.
- Okay.

- [Interviewer] Here we go.
Do you think you can show me a little bit
of your Kentucky accent before we go?
- I don't really have it anymore,
but if I did it would sound like this.

- [Interviewer] Wow, feels like I'm in Frankfurt right now.
- Frankfurt?

- [Interviewer] I know my Kentucky cities.
- Yeah, but I'm from Louisville.

- [Interviewer] Yes, you are.
Jen, thank you so much for doing this interview.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much for endangering my life.
