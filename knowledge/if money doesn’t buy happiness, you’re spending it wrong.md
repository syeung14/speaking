- The idea that money can't buy happiness is a load of "beep."
- Money will make you happier.
There are certain `expenditures` that have a direct link
to our increased happiness, and it's ones
that are spent on things that enhance our experiences.
And so, understanding how to use money to enhance
your happiness is very, very important.
- My partner and I knew that we wanted to leave
our hometown of Columbia, South Carolina.
So we decided to sell 90% of our things and hit the road—
and really  `stack up` the experiences
instead of buying more possessions as we lived
our lives the way that we want to live them.
- If you want to use money to become happier,
I say all the time,
"Experiences are greater than stuff."
And all the research supports this.
- Happiness isn't on any shelves.
We can't order it online,
but there are things that we want.
There are goals that we have.
There are things we want to see in our life
that money can help us achieve.
- Can the way we choose to spend or not spend
our money unlock `the greatest happiness` in our lives?
This is "Your Brain on Money."

- Experiences, take one, marker.

- So the saying about money
and happiness, among scientists,
is somewhat `cynical` but true— is that if money doesn't
buy you happiness, you're spending it the wrong way.
It could buy you happiness.
It's just that right now we're spending it
in a way that isn't focused on happiness.
It's focused on things that we think
are gonna make us happy, and are not.
- Handling money creates an experience
of `euphoria` that can last for hours.
And we get stuck in this mindset of consumption;
it's one of the ways that we're wired
to do things wrong about money.
- Spending money on `gadgets and possessions`
can give us `an immediate sense of gratification`,
but doesn't usually lead to long-term happiness.
Why do we `feel compelled` to do it?
- In our brain, we have mechanisms
that operate very short-term.
You enjoy it for the moment,
and then you go back to reality.
- Think back to as a child, you got a really shiny toy.
You have that initial burst of joy.
This is so cool and so exciting.
And then pretty soon you forget about it, and it breaks.
That shiny new object `will lose its luster`,
and you will not have a long-lasting
happiness associated with that.
And as a matter of fact, it could
`backfire and make you feel worse`.
- You enjoy it for the moment,
but then because that's all it is,
is a short-lived thing, it basically fades away.
You have a spike of happiness for a moment,
and then you go back to reality.
Now, there are ways to fix that.
- Even though our brain has evolved
to enjoy short-term purchases,
research has shown that spending money
on experiences instead of possessions can have
a bigger impact on our happiness over time.
What part of the brain is at work here?
- So, if you have the option to buy a memory of a vacation
that you can tell as a story again and again,
you get to enjoy it every time you load the memory
and share it and store it and share it,
and store it and share it many, many times.
It's a long-term investment in an experience.

- So every time you connect back to that,
you experience a little bit of the happiness.
Versus a purchase— you buy something,
and you can feel good in that moment,
you might feel good when you see it, but over time,
you see it over and over, that happiness diminishes.
It is not the same as an experience.
- There are certain expenditures that have a direct link
to our increased happiness, and it's ones
that are spent on things that enhance our experiences.
So for example, let's say that you bought
a mountain bike and now you get to go out
into nature and have that experience.
Well, that mountain bike will make you
happier every time you're using it.
- So yes, there's research that shows
that if you spend money on material goods,
you don't experience as much happiness
or satisfaction in the long run as if you spent it
on experiences like going sailing,
going on a trip, spending time with family.
However, I think it really depends
on someone's individual, money personality.
One of the ways to do it is just to really,
for a week, decide, “I'm just gonna pay attention
to what are the things that I absolutely love to do?”
“What are the things where I lose myself
in doing them, and what feels important to me?”
- If you are a person that has valued saving money, great.
I would also encourage you
to think about how are you maybe using
some of those funds to create experiences?
What would it be like to do something
with your family, your partner, your friends
that could be a memory that you have for a lifetime?
- Knowing what we do about how our brains work,
how do we make the most of our time and money
when we're looking for happiness?
Of course, it's impossible to avoid some purchases—
and some of our possessions, like owning a home,
can be important for our long-term
financial health and happiness.
But how do we get the most happiness
out of our `discretionary spending`?
- From an early age, I learned that life
is about the stories that we share.
And there are very few stories that you're gonna be able
to share off this coffee maker that you bought,
or this car that you finally got in your driveway.
So think about a concert that you've been to,
whether it was now, or when you were a teenager.
Think about the best dinner that you've had.
The best vacation you've been on.
These are experiences that pay dividends
time and time again.
- So when I'm talking about things like spending money
on vacation or spending money
to get the car of your dreams— that's great
if and when your personal finance needs are met.
So, everybody is different, but in general,
we want to think about making sure
that you have an emergency fund available,
and funded in a way that feels good for you.
And we also want to think about: ‘Is this purchase,
whether it's an experience or whether it's a thing,
actually something that I can afford?’
So for those of you who are saying,
"Great, I wanna save up my money
and do an `experiential trip`
with my family and my loved ones,
but I'm not able to right now,"
the good news is, right now, there might be a creative way
to create those types of connections that you're craving.
We can connect and bond with friends
and loved ones in ways that maybe
don't necessarily involve spending money.
- A question that I ask my clients is:
'Will this financial decision
bring me closer to my wellness?'
The way that you're spending your money,
is it going to improve your life
when it comes to your finances,
your emotions, your physical health?
You wanna make sure that you're
bringing utility to your life—
and experiences do that better than anything you can buy.
